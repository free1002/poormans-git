Motivation:
Recently I worked with a php programmer who don't know about source version control systems. He don't set 
local development environment and do his works in shared development server without any backup systems. 
I need some systems for doing backup his source codes and tracking his code-changes. Therefore, I wrote 
this tiny script for doing backup his codes at remote git repository. (I use bitbucket for creating 
free-private repository) Finally, I could pull and merge codes in safely and do tracking his code-changes.

How to use:
1. install python
2. copy backup.py to your git repository
3. do backup.py - This script just do below actions sequentially:
  git add .
  git rm <deleted file>
  git commit -m 'backup'
  git push
